## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - Performant, flexible and extensible forms with easy-to-use validation

- [React Anchor Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll) - React component for anchor links

### What I learned

- How to preconfigure utilities with Tailwind CSS.
- How to use Tailwind CSS as a tool to write clean inline CSS and use it for responsiveness.

```html
   <p className="mt-5 xlg:mt-10 sm:text-lg
   leading-snug sm:px-16 md:px-48 xlg:px-56 xlg:text-2xl">
   Fylo stores all your most important files in 
   one secure location. Access them wherever you
   need, share and collaborate with friends
   family, and co-workers.
   </p>
```
- How to insert types in Javascript using Typescript.
```js
export interface TeamType {
  profileImage: string;
  name: string;
  position: string;
  text: string;
}
```


### Continued development

I intend to focus more on the structures of the components and on aligning things more, such as making all the texts in similar proportions.

And also in improving the background-image.

### Useful resources

- [Tutorial to build a responsive website using React and Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2NNxr3WPDo&t=1190s) - This helped me to structure the project and use the tools I intended to learn with the project.
